	- Introduction to DevOps 
	
	- Introduction to Azure DevOps Services
	
	
	DevOps ?
	
	SDLC Process ::: Software Development Lifecycle
	
	Software Application :
	
		- Web Applications 
		
		- Mobile Applications 
		
		- Desktop Applications 
		
		- System Software Applications
		
		- Embedded Software Applications
		
			Chip Level Programming 
	
	
	
	Desktop Application ::
	
		- Billing System to a Super-Market
		
			- Functions:
				- Create a user-interface 
				- Create Login Process 
				- Inventory Management 
				- Database Management 
				- Payment - Cash 
					Card Payment

	SDLC Process ::: Software Development Lifecycle:

		1. Requirement Analysis 
		2. Design
		3. Coding - Application Development 
		4. Testing
		5. Implemented to Production 
		6. Monitoring/Maintainence of project
		
	Water-fall Model ::
		- Linear in fashion
		- Top-down Approach
		- It was implemented for tightly coupled application architecture 
			- Monolith Application Architecture
				- tightly coupled application 

		Core_project :
			1. Requirement Analysis 				- 5 functions, 8 Months
			2. Design
			3. Coding - Application Development 	- 4 Month
			4. Testing
			5. Implemented to Production 
			6. Monitoring/Maintainence of project

		Enhancement_project :
			1. Requirement Analysis 				
			2. Design
			3. Coding - Application Development 	
			4. Testing
			5. Implemented to Production 
			6. Monitoring/Maintainence of project
		
		
	AGILE Methodologies :::
	
		The Project/Application will be splitted into various function/modules/Iterations
	
		- Using AGILE Methodologies 
			We can achieve :
			
				- Continuous Development
				- Continuous Integration 
				- Continuous Testing 
				- Continuous Delivery 
					- It is used to release the changes to production environment with manual approvals
					- This expects manual/Approval intervension for Production Releases
					- Expect Downtime during production release
		
			We cannot Achieve :
			
				- Continuous Deployment 
					- This is used to release the changes to Production Environment without any manual approvals	
					- Zero-Downtime during production release.
					
			- Functions:
				- Create a user-interface 
				- Create Login Process 
				- Inventory Management 
				- Database Management 
				- Payment - Cash 
					Card Payment
					
		Iteration1:  Create a user-interface 

			1. Requirement Analysis 				
			2. Design
			3. Coding - Application Development 	
			4. Testing
			5. Implemented to further testing

		Iteration2:  Create Login Process  

			1. Requirement Analysis 				
			2. Design
			3. Coding - Application Development 	
			4. Testing
			5. Implemented to further testing
			

		Iteration - nth:  	Card Payment 

			1. Requirement Analysis 				
			2. Design
			3. Coding - Application Development 	
			4. Testing
			5. Implemented to further testing
		
	DevOps :
		- DevOps is a Software Development Strategy/Process which helps promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring in a more automated fashion.
		
	How to Implement DevOps ???
	
		Teams:

		DevOps Team :
			- Infra-Structure Management Team 		- Create Infra-Structure & Configure Infra-Structure - IAC 
			- Applications Development Team
			- Testing Team 
			- Release Management Team 
			- Production Support Team 
			- Production Monitoring Team 
			- Security Team 
			
	
		Detailed DevOps Assessment:
		
			- Assessment Report :::
			
				- Choose the DevOps Tools :
			
			
		DevOps Stages :::
		
			- Continuous Development :
				- It is a capability of Development Team to Continuously Develop the Business Application
				- Improve the developers productivity.
				
				- Role of Developer :
				
					Develop Business Application Coding 
					
				1. Coding -- Java / C#.net  High Level Lang.
				2. Application Build  
					- It is process of compiling the source code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.exec/*.dll) 
				3. Perform Unit Testing 
				4. Promote the changes for further testing
				5. Notify the Testing Team thru Email
								
			DevOps Approach:
			
				1. Coding the Application 
				2. Save/Commit the code in the source code repository(github/azure repo)
				
			Thru DevOps Automation (Pipeline):
			
				3. Application Build  
					- It is process of compiling the source code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.exec/*.dll) 
				4. Perform Unit Testing 
				5. Promote the changes for further testing
				6. Notify the Testing Team thru. Email			

			
				Tools:
				
					IDEs - Integrated Development Environment - Eclipse based IDEs, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Pycharm
					git,github/Azure Repos				
			
			- Continuous Integration ::
				- It is a capability of Development Team to Continuously Integrate the changes for further Testing.
			
				Tools:

					IDEs - Integrated Development Environment - Eclipse based IDEs, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Pycharm
					git,github/Azure Repos		
					Azure Pipeline/Jenkins/gitlab-ci

				
			- Continuous Testing ::
			
				- Process of Continuously Test the Changes without impacting others
				
				Testing 
				
					QA  - Quality Assurance Testing 
					UAT - User Acceptance Testing 
				
				Tools :
				
					Azure Pipeline/Jenkins/gitlab-ci
					Selenium/TestNG/Azure Test Service
						- Test Data/Test Scenarios/Cases
			
			- Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment
				- Both Continuous Delivery & Deployment are used to perform Production Releases.
			
				- Continuous Delivery 
					- It is used to release the changes to production environment with manual approvals
					- This expects manual/Approval intervension for Production Releases
					- Expect Downtime during production release

					Eg.: 
					Banking Service - Online Banking Service ::
					
						SMS Notifications to customers 
						
						Production Release Window -- Off-Business Hours - Weekends/Early Mornings
							4hrs - 6hrs - Prod level testing 
							
								- If there is any issue during release 
									- Fix the issue.
									- Revert the Changes. 
									
				- Continuous Deployment 
					- This is used to release the changes to Production Environment without any manual approvals	
					- Zero-Downtime during production release.
					
					Eg.: 
					Facebook/Netflix/Google/Amazon
					
				Tools :
				
					Azure Pipeline/Azure-Aritfacts/Jenkins/gitlab-ci	

				Application Architecture :::
				
					- Monolith Application Architecture
							- Tightly coupled application - function/modules
							
					- Micro-Service Based Application Architecture
						- Function/modules are called as Micro-Services
						
				Web-Application - E_Commerce :::

				Virtual Machine ::: 
				
					- VMs are Created using Hypervisor 
					- VMs are Hardware level Virtualization 
					- VMs are used to run Operating System
					- VMs will continue to run even if there is no Active task/Application
					- VMs Consume more space and time to start-up
					
					
				Containers :::

					- Containers are Created using Container Engine 
					- Containers are OS level Virtualization 
					- Containers are used to run the Tasks/Applications and NOT Operating System
					- If there is no task/Application, Container will immediately go to EXIT State.
					- Containers Consume less space and time to start the application and the execution will be faster

			apt install docker.io -y
			
			
	Misc Docker CLI Commands ::
	
		docker --version
		
		docker images 			# List the Container Images in that local machine 
		
		docker ps 				# List the Active/Running Containers
		
		docker ps -a			# List all the Container(running/stopped state) 

		Containers :::

			- Containers are Created using Container Engine 
			- Containers are OS level Virtualization 
			- Containers are used to run the Tasks/Applications and NOT Operating System
			- If there is no task/Application, Container will immediately go to EXIT State.
			- Containers Consume less space and time to start the application and the execution will be faster
			
		Modes of Container Execution	
			- Foreground/Attached Mode		! This will lock the terminal 	
					docker run centos 
				
			- Backgorund/Detached Mode
					docker run -d centos sleep 20
				
			- Interactive Mode 
					docker run -it centos bash
					
		
		docker exec -it <container_id> bash			# used to Login to running container
		docker exec -it b1ed842a8c4f bash
		
		docker stop <Container_id>
		docker start <Container_id>
		
		Container Port Mapping / Binding 
		
		
		docker run -it -p 8085:8080 tomcat:8.0
		
		-p <Host_Port>:<Container Port>
		
		Docker Volume :
		
			Used to maintain the persistant Volume to the Container.
			
			Stateless Applications	- Will no have any trace of execution 
			Stateful Applications	- Will have any trace of execution atleast in the form of Log files,Report,
			
			
			Persistant Volume :::

			docker volume list 
			docker volume create v1

		Terraform to provision Azure Resources 
		
		Code Quality Check using Sonar Cloud/SonarQube 
		
		
		
		IAC Tools --> 
		
			Infra-Structure Provisioning! 
			
			Azure ->
			
				Adhoc Requirement - bug fixing/Change Request 
			
			Aug_rel:
			
			Build Cycles 		- Build Servers (Self Hosted Agents)
			
			Test Cycles			- Test Servers (Self Hosted Agents)
			
			Release Cycles
			
			
			Dynamically Create the Self Hosted Agents for Adhoc Request :
			
			Build_Server 
			
			Web App_Server 
			
			IAC Tools - Terraform 
			
				- Terraform is a IAC Tools used for Provisioning the Infra-Structure/Resources.
				
				
				- Add/Create the resource 			+ 
				
				- Destroy/Delete the resource 		-
			
				- Update/Modify the resource		~
				
			
			Install Terraform : 			
					- In Local Windows/Linux/Mac
							https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli
							
						Download AMD64 package for Windows 
						
						Extract 
						
						terraform.exe
						
						Setup the Environment Variable for terraform
					
			Visual Studio Code IDE :
					- To Code the Terraform Scripts 
					
						https://code.visualstudio.com/download
						
						Install VS Code 
						
						Install Hashicorp Terraform Extension for VS Code 
						Azure Terraform Extension 
			
			Target Infra-Structure :
			
					- Azure / AWS / GCP
					- On-prem Servers 
					
			Working Principle/Model:::
			
				Is a IAC Tool used to provision the resource(Azure/AWS/GCP/VMware,AKS,EKS,)
				
			1. Identify the scope (Target Environment)
			2. Write the Terraform Script to Create the Resources		
						# Terraform Scripts are written using HCL(Hashicorp Declarative Language) - it is based on json file format
				Az  - Virtual Machine 
				AWS - EC2 Instance 
			3. Terraform Init -- Is used to download the terraform provider
			4. Terraform Plan --> Is used to Preview the Script
			5. Terraform Apply --> Is used to implement the changes on the target envionment

}
	
	
	Infra-Structure Provisioning :
	
		Release-Pipeline :
			Terraform Script should be part of source code repo.
			
			src_code repo.
			
			Terraform Task.
			
	
		CI/CD Pipeline :
			builds & Deployments
	
	
	terraform.tfstate ????
		- Is used to maintain the current state of the resource.

	CICD Pipeline Workflow :::
	
	Pipeline Stages :

		SCM_Checkout 
		
		Application Build --> Compile and create artifacts and unit testing(10 unit test cases)
		
		SonarQube Analysis
			- Bugs,
			- Vul,
			- Coverage - Code Coverage & Test Coverage 
			
			- Verify the Quality Gating.
		
		Docker Build 		--> create application images 
		
		Publish image to container Registry 
		
		Deploy to Non-Kubernetes Cluster 
			QA Namespace 
			
			UAT Namespace 
	
		Deploy to Prod-Kubernetes Cluster 	
			Prod-Namespace
