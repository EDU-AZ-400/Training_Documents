************************

	- Introduction to DevOps 
	
	- Introduction to Azure DevOps Services
	
	
	DevOps ?
	
	SDLC Process ::: Software Development Lifecycle
	
	Software Application :
	
		- Web Applications 
		
		- Mobile Applications 
		
		- Desktop Applications 
		
		- System Software Applications
		
		- Embedded Software Applications
		
			Chip Level Programming 
	
	
	
	Desktop Application ::
	
		- Billing System to a Super-Market
		
			- Functions:
				- Create a user-interface 
				- Create Login Process 
				- Inventory Management 
				- Database Management 
				- Payment - Cash 
					Card Payment

	SDLC Process ::: Software Development Lifecycle:

		1. Requirement Analysis 
		2. Design
		3. Coding - Application Development 
		4. Testing
		5. Implemented to Production 
		6. Monitoring/Maintainence of project
		
	Water-fall Model ::
		- Linear in fashion
		- Top-down Approach
		- It was implemented for tightly coupled application architecture 
			- Monolith Application Architecture
				- tightly coupled application 

		Core_project :
			1. Requirement Analysis 				- 5 functions, 8 Months
			2. Design
			3. Coding - Application Development 	- 4 Month
			4. Testing
			5. Implemented to Production 
			6. Monitoring/Maintainence of project

		Enhancement_project :
			1. Requirement Analysis 				
			2. Design
			3. Coding - Application Development 	
			4. Testing
			5. Implemented to Production 
			6. Monitoring/Maintainence of project
		
		
	AGILE Methodologies :::
	
		The Project/Application will be splitted into various function/modules/Iterations
	
		- Using AGILE Methodologies 
			We can achieve :
			
				- Continuous Development
				- Continuous Integration 
				- Continuous Testing 
				- Continuous Delivery 
					- It is used to release the changes to production environment with manual approvals
					- This expects manual/Approval intervension for Production Releases
					- Expect Downtime during production release
		
			We cannot Achieve :
			
				- Continuous Deployment 
					- This is used to release the changes to Production Environment without any manual approvals	
					- Zero-Downtime during production release.
					
			- Functions:
				- Create a user-interface 
				- Create Login Process 
				- Inventory Management 
				- Database Management 
				- Payment - Cash 
					Card Payment
					
		Iteration1:  Create a user-interface 

			1. Requirement Analysis 				
			2. Design
			3. Coding - Application Development 	
			4. Testing
			5. Implemented to further testing

		Iteration2:  Create Login Process  

			1. Requirement Analysis 				
			2. Design
			3. Coding - Application Development 	
			4. Testing
			5. Implemented to further testing
			

		Iteration - nth:  	Card Payment 

			1. Requirement Analysis 				
			2. Design
			3. Coding - Application Development 	
			4. Testing
			5. Implemented to further testing
		
	DevOps :
		- DevOps is a Software Development Strategy/Process which helps promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring in a more automated fashion.
		
	How to Implement DevOps ???
	
		Teams:

		DevOps Team :
			- Infra-Structure Management Team 		- Create Infra-Structure & Configure Infra-Structure - IAC 
			- Applications Development Team
			- Testing Team 
			- Release Management Team 
			- Production Support Team 
			- Production Monitoring Team 
			- Security Team 
			
	
		Detailed DevOps Assessment:
		
			- Assessment Report :::
			
				- Choose the DevOps Tools :
			
			
		DevOps Stages :::
		
			- Continuous Development :
				- It is a capability of Development Team to Continuously Develop the Business Application
				- Improve the developers productivity.
				
				- Role of Developer :
				
					Develop Business Application Coding 
					
				1. Coding -- Java / C#.net  High Level Lang.
				2. Application Build  
					- It is process of compiling the source code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.exec/*.dll) 
				3. Perform Unit Testing 
				4. Promote the changes for further testing
				5. Notify the Testing Team thru Email
								
			DevOps Approach:
			
				1. Coding the Application 
				2. Save/Commit the code in the source code repository(github/azure repo)
				
			Thru DevOps Automation (Pipeline):
			
				3. Application Build  
					- It is process of compiling the source code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.exec/*.dll) 
				4. Perform Unit Testing 
				5. Promote the changes for further testing
				6. Notify the Testing Team thru. Email			

			
				Tools:
				
					IDEs - Integrated Development Environment - Eclipse based IDEs, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Pycharm
					git,github/Azure Repos				
			
			- Continuous Integration ::
				- It is a capability of Development Team to Continuously Integrate the changes for further Testing.
			
				Tools:

					IDEs - Integrated Development Environment - Eclipse based IDEs, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Pycharm
					git,github/Azure Repos		
					Azure Pipeline/Jenkins/gitlab-ci

				
			- Continuous Testing ::
			
				- Process of Continuously Test the Changes without impacting others
				
				Testing 
				
					QA  - Quality Assurance Testing 
					UAT - User Acceptance Testing 
				
				Tools :
				
					Azure Pipeline/Jenkins/gitlab-ci
					Selenium/TestNG/Azure Test Service
						- Test Data/Test Scenarios/Cases
			
			- Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment
				- Both Continuous Delivery & Deployment are used to perform Production Releases.
			
				- Continuous Delivery 
					- It is used to release the changes to production environment with manual approvals
					- This expects manual/Approval intervension for Production Releases
					- Expect Downtime during production release

					Eg.: 
					Banking Service - Online Banking Service ::
					
						SMS Notifications to customers 
						
						Production Release Window -- Off-Business Hours - Weekends/Early Mornings
							4hrs - 6hrs - Prod level testing 
							
								- If there is any issue during release 
									- Fix the issue.
									- Revert the Changes. 
									
				- Continuous Deployment 
					- This is used to release the changes to Production Environment without any manual approvals	
					- Zero-Downtime during production release.
					
					Eg.: 
					Facebook/Netflix/Google/Amazon
					
				Tools :
				
					Azure Pipeline/Azure-Aritfacts/Jenkins/gitlab-ci	

				Application Architecture :::
				
					- Monolith Application Architecture
							- Tightly coupled application - function/modules
							
					- Micro-Service Based Application Architecture
						- Function/modules are called as Micro-Services
						
				Web-Application - E_Commerce :::
				
				www.amazon.com 
				
				Sign_up			- Micro-Service1 - 3-tier application(Front_End/Appln./Database) - develop,test,promote to prod
				Sign-In 		- Micro-Service2
				Search 
				Add to cart 
				place the order 
				payment 
				confirm
				track
			
			- Continuous Monitoring ::
			
				- Prevent the production downtime
				
				- Infra-Structure Monitoring
					Memory/CPU/Network/Storage/Traffic
					
					Alerts - Azure Monitor/Prometheus/Grafana/Dynatrace 
					
				- Application Monitoring
				
					AppDynamics/DataDog
					
			
			- Infra-Structure Management Team:
			
				- Provision/Create the Infra-Structure	- Terraform/ARM/Cloudformation
				
				- Configure the Infra-Structure			- Ansible/chef/puppet

							C6  Angular_build				
				
				
				Deployment Perspective			: Is used Deploy the Applications to Target envionment without any compactibility Issues.
				
				
				
				Virtual Machine ::: 
				
					- VMs are Created using Hypervisor 
					- VMs are Hardware level Virtualization 
					- VMs are used to run Operating System
					- VMs will continue to run even if there is no Active task/Application
					- VMs Consume more space and time to start-up
					
					
				Containers :::

					- Containers are Created using Container Engine 
					- Containers are OS level Virtualization 
					- Containers are used to run the Tasks/Applications and NOT Operating System
					- If there is no task/Application, Container will immediately go to EXIT State.
					- Containers Consume less space and time to start the application and the execution will be faster
